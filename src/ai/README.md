# Bot AI

This directory contains all parts of the RL trained Bots. There are three mayor parts, aligned to the architecture.

1. `dealer`: This directory provides a cards dealer which deals cards ("Spielerkarten" and Non-"Spielerkarten") for training
2. `select_card`: This directory contains all components to select a card during training based on some RL trained ai.
3. `select_game_type`: This directory contains all components to decide if the ai wants to play a game as "Spieler" and
   in case which type of game.
